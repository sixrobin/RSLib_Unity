# RSLib (Unity)
A collection of scripts and shaders written or found, and used over the years for Unity projects.
All of the library content is made to usable in any Unity project, although the Miscellaneous folder contains stuff that could be used but is either WIP or very specific.

Please keep in mind that some of this stuff has been made a while ago, or initially for specific needs, or even for pure personal training purpose: some better working codes, even Unity packages, may already exist and do a better job at what some of my tools tend to do.


## Scripts folders content
- **A\*:** generic A* pathfinding implementation, with some demo scripts and scene.
- **Audio:** audio management system, working with ScriptableObjects.
- **Collections:** FixedSizedConcurrentQueue, Heap, Loop and WeightedList (for probability stuff).
- **ColorPicker:** UI color wheel and script to click on a color to select it.
- **Data:** ScriptableObjects containing data, such as integers, floats, strings, layer masks, etc.
- **Disabled:** custom script to reproduce Odin Inspector's ReadOnly attribute.
- **Encryption:** Rjindeal encryption implementation.
- **Localization:** custom localization implementation working with .csv files.
- **Maths:** lots of math functions (geometry, algebra, BowyerWatson triangulation, easing curves, etc.).
- **Noise:** scripts related to noise functions or textures generation.
- **Optionals:** bound between a bool and another value, to make some fields optional to the users.
- **UI:** user interface related scripts.
- **AnimationCurves:** static properties for predefined AnimationCurves.
- **DontDestroyOnLoad:** makes the gameObject this script is attached to not destroyed on scene load.
- **HealthSystem:** generic class for a unit health system (with min/max values, events on values changed, etc.).
- **Helpers:** class containing methods that can be used in many contexts (random boolean, CopyToClipboard function, etc.).
- **RandomNumberGenerator:** deterministic random number generator, that state can be saved/loaded.

_And some more minor standalone scripts..._


## Framework
- **Events:** ScriptableObjects based event system.
- **FSM:** generic finite state machine implementation.
- **GameSettings:** game settings, accessible to players, generic implementation.

- **Yield:** custom wait instructions for IEnumerators.
- **CSVReader:** csv file parser.
- **SceneField:** draws a scene field in any custom editor.
- **Singleton:** to make any object use the singleton pattern by deriving from this class.
- **TopologicalSorter:** sorts items based on dependencies between them, handling cyclic dependencies.
